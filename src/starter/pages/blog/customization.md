# Customizing Your Site

Baked Site Generator is designed to be easily customizable. Here's how to make it your own.

## Templates

Templates are in the `assets/templates` directory. You can:

1. Modify existing templates
2. Create new template variations
3. Use template inheritance

## Styling

The main CSS file is in `assets/css/main.css`. Some tips:

- Use CSS variables for consistent theming
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Keep it minimal for fast loading

## Components

Create reusable components in `assets/components` for:

- Navigation menus
- Article cards
- Footer sections
- And more!

Check the [documentation](/docs/customization) for detailed guides.
